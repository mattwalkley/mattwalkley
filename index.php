				<h1>Hello, I'm Matt Walkley and I create things for the web.</h1>
				<p class="lead">I have a passion for creating awesome websites &amp; applications that are both <strong>functional</strong> and <em>beautiful</em>.</p>
				
				<h2><span class="block blue">UX</span> User Experience</h2>
				<p>Designing for the web doesn't start on a piece of paper or with a Photoshop canvas. It starts with the needs and expectations of a user. I enjoy observing these behaviors and converting them into well-purposed language and design.</p>

				<h2><span class="block teal">UI</span> Pixels</h2>
				<p>Watching a concept take shape is a beautiful thing. When that shape is both simple and elegant, I couldn't be happier. I see web design as the chance to creatively solve the most handsome of problems.</p>

				<h2><span class="block red">&lt;/&gt;</span> Code</h2>
				<p>What use is web design when it's just a picture? I believe that front-end development is the realization of web design in it's final medium &mdash; the browser. I pride myself in clean, semantic code that proves itself to be reusable and extendable.</p>
