				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>I am a Virginia native with a passion for the web, music, and bbq. For the past eight years I've lived in the DC area sitting in traffic, building tons of great websites, and working with a lot of really great people.</p>
				<p>The time has come now to embrace my southern roots and familial heritage, strap on my boots (did i mention I use <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/" target="_blank">Bootstrap?</a>), and start a new <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com" target="_blank">foundation</a> in Nashville. I've been gearing up by watching the show and listening to the soundtrack on repeat.</p>
